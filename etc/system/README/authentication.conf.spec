#   Version 6.0
#
# This file contains possible attributes and values for configuring authentication via 
# authentication.conf.
#
# There is an authentication.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default/.  To set custom configurations, 
# place an authentication.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/. For examples, see 
# authentication.conf.example.  You must restart Splunk to enable configurations.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see the documentation 
# located at http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles

# GLOBAL SETTINGS
# Use the [default] stanza to define any global settings.
#     * You can also define global settings outside of any stanza, at the top of the file.
#     * Each conf file should have at most one default stanza. If there are multiple default
#       stanzas, attributes are combined. In the case of multiple definitions of the same
#       attribute, the last definition in the file wins.
#     * If an attribute is defined at both the global level and in a specific stanza, the
#       value in the specific stanza takes precedence.

[authentication]
    * Follow this stanza name with any number of the following attribute/value pairs.

authType = [Splunk|LDAP|Scripted]
    * Specify which authentication system to use.
    * Supported values: Splunk, LDAP, Scripted.
    * Defaults to Splunk.

authSettings = <authSettings-key>,<authSettings-key>,...
    * Key to look up the specific configurations of chosen authentication system.
    * <authSettings-key> is the name of a stanza header that specifies attributes for an LDAP strategy 
      or for scripted authentication. Those stanzas are defined below.
    * For LDAP, specify the LDAP strategy name(s) here. If you want Splunk to query multiple LDAP servers, 
      enter a comma-separated list of all strategies. Each strategy must be defined in its own stanza. The order in 
      which you specify the strategy names will be the order Splunk uses to query their servers when looking for a user.
    * For scripted authentication, <authSettings-key> should be a single stanza name.

passwordHashAlgorithm = [SHA512-crypt|SHA256-crypt|SHA512-crypt-<num_rounds>|SHA256-crypt-<num_rounds>|MD5-crypt]
    * For the default "Splunk" authType, this controls how hashed passwords are stored in the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/passwd file.
    * "MD5-crypt" is an algorithm originally developed for FreeBSD in the early 1990's which became a widely used
      standard among UNIX machines.  It was also used by Splunk up through the 5.0.x releases.  MD5-crypt runs the
      salted password through a sequence of 1000 MD5 operations.
    * "SHA256-crypt" and "SHA512-crypt" are newer versions that use 5000 rounds of the SHA256 or SHA512 hash
      functions.  This is slower than MD5-crypt and therefore more resistant to dictionary attacks.  SHA512-crypt
      is used for system passwords on many versions of Linux.
    * These SHA-based algorithm can optionally be followed by a number of rounds to use.  For example,
      "SHA512-crypt-10000" will use twice as many rounds of hashing as the default implementation.  The
      number of rounds must be at least 1000.
    * This setting only affects new password settings (either when a user is added or a user's password
      is changed)  Existing passwords will continue to work but retain their previous hashing algorithm.
    * The default is "SHA512-crypt".

# LDAP settings
#####################

[<authSettings-key>]
    * Follow this stanza name with the attribute/value pairs listed below.
    * For multiple strategies, you will need to specify multiple instances of this stanza, each with its
      own stanza name and a separate set of attributes.
    * The <authSettings-key> must be one of the values listed in the authSettings attribute, specified above 
      in the [authentication] stanza.

host = <string>
    * REQUIRED
    * This is the hostname of LDAP server.
    * Be sure that your Splunk server can resolve the host name.

SSLEnabled = [0|1]
    * OPTIONAL 
    * Defaults to disabled (0)
    * See the file $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/openldap/openldap.conf for SSL LDAP settings

port = <integer>
    * OPTIONAL
    * This is the port that Splunk should use to connect to your LDAP server.
    * Defaults to port 389 for non-SSL and port 636 for SSL

bindDN = <string>
    * OPTIONAL but usually required due to LDAP security settings.
    * Leave this blank if your LDAP entries can be retrieved with anonymous bind
    * Distinguished name of the user that will be retrieving the LDAP entries
    * This user must have read access to all LDAP users and groups you wish to use in Splunk.

bindDNpassword = <string>
    * OPTIONAL, leave this blank if anonymous bind is sufficient
    * Password for the bindDN user.

userBaseDN = <string>
    * REQUIRED
    * This is the distinguished names of LDAP entries whose subtrees contain the users
    * Enter a ';' delimited list to search multiple trees.

userBaseFilter = <string>
    * OPTIONAL
    * This is the LDAP search filter you wish to use when searching for users.
    * Highly recommended, especially when there are many entries in your LDAP user subtrees
    * When used properly, search filters can significantly speed up LDAP queries
    * Example that matches users in the IT or HR department:
        * userBaseFilter = (|(department=IT)(department=HR))
        * See RFC 2254 for more detailed information on search filter syntax
    * This defaults to no filtering.

userNameAttribute = <string>
    * REQUIRED 
    * This is the user entry attribute whose value is the username.
    * NOTE: This attribute should use case insensitive matching for its values, and the values should not contain whitespace
        * Users are case insensitive in Splunk
    * In Active Directory, this is 'sAMAccountName'
    * A typical attribute for this is 'uid'

realNameAttribute = <string>
    * REQUIRED
    * This is the user entry attribute whose value is their real name (human readable).
    * A typical attribute for this is 'cn'

groupMappingAttribute  = <string>
    * OPTIONAL
    * This is the user entry attribute whose value is used by group entries to declare membership.
    * Groups are often mapped with user DN, so this defaults to 'dn'
    * Set this if groups are mapped using a different attribute
        * Usually only needed for OpenLDAP servers.
        * A typical attribute used to map users to groups is 'uid'
            * For example, assume a group declares that one of its members is 'splunkuser'
            * This implies that every user with 'uid' value 'splunkuser' will be mapped to that group

groupBaseDN = [<string>;<string>;...]
    * REQUIRED
    * This is the distinguished names of LDAP entries whose subtrees contain the groups.
    * Enter a ';' delimited list to search multiple trees.
    * If your LDAP environment does not have group entries, there is a configuration that can treat each user as its own group
        * Set groupBaseDN to the same as userBaseDN, which means you will search for groups in the same place as users
        * Next, set the groupMemberAttribute and groupMappingAttribute to the same attribute as userNameAttribute
            * This means the entry, when treated as a group, will use the username value as its only member
        * For clarity, you should probably also set groupNameAttribute to the same value as userNameAttribute as well

groupBaseFilter = <string>
    * OPTIONAL
    * The LDAP search filter Splunk uses when searching for static groups
    * Like userBaseFilter, this is highly recommended to speed up LDAP queries
    * See RFC 2254 for more information
    * This defaults to no filtering

dynamicGroupFilter = <string>
    * OPTIONAL
    * The LDAP search filter Splunk uses when searching for dynamic groups
    * Only configure this if you intend to retrieve dynamic groups on your LDAP server
    * Example: '(objectclass=groupOfURLs)'

dynamicMemberAttribute = <string>
    * OPTIONAL
    * Only configure this if you intend to retrieve dynamic groups on your LDAP server
    * This is REQUIRED if you want to retrieve dynamic groups
    * This attribute contains the LDAP URL needed to retrieve members dynamically
    * Example: 'memberURL'

groupNameAttribute = <string>
    * REQUIRED
    * This is the group entry attribute whose value stores the group name.
    * A typical attribute for this is 'cn' (common name)
    * Recall that if you are configuring LDAP to treat user entries as their own group, user entries must have this attribute

groupMemberAttribute = <string>
    * REQUIRED
    * This is the group entry attribute whose values are the groups members
    * Typical attributes for this are 'member' and 'memberUid'
    * For example, consider the groupMappingAttribute example above using groupMemberAttribute 'member'
        * To declare 'splunkuser' as a group member, its attribute 'member' must have the value 'splunkuser'

nestedGroups = <bool>
    * OPTIONAL
    * Controls whether Splunk will expand nested groups using the 'memberof' extension.
    * Set to 1 if you have nested groups you want to expand and the 'memberof' extension on your LDAP server.

charset = <string>
    * OPTIONAL
    * ONLY set this for an LDAP setup that returns non-UTF-8 encoded data. LDAP is supposed to always return UTF-8 encoded 
data (See RFC 2251), but some tools incorrectly return other encodings.
    * Follows the same format as CHARSET in props.conf (see props.conf.spec)
    * An example value would be "latin-1"

anonymous_referrals = <bool>
    * OPTIONAL
    * Set this to 0 to turn off referral chasing
    * Set this to 1 to turn on anonymous referral chasing
    * IMPORTANT: We only chase referrals using anonymous bind. We do NOT support rebinding using credentials.
    * If you do not need referral support, we recommend setting this to 0
    * If you wish to make referrals work, set this to 1 and ensure your server allows anonymous searching
    * Defaults to 1

sizelimit = <integer>
    * OPTIONAL
    * Limits the amount of entries we request in LDAP search
    * IMPORTANT: The max entries returned is still subject to the maximum imposed by your LDAP server
       * Example: If you set this to 5000 and the server limits it to 1000, you'll still only get 1000 entries back
    * Defaults to 1000

timelimit = <integer>
    * OPTIONAL
    * Limits the amount of time in seconds we will wait for an LDAP search request to complete
    * If your searches finish quickly, you should lower this value from the default
    * Defaults to 15

network_timeout = <integer>
    * OPTIONAL
    * Limits the amount of time a socket will poll a connection without activity
    * This is useful for determining if your LDAP server cannot be reached
    * IMPORTANT: As a connection could be waiting for search results, this value must be higher than 'timelimit'
    * Like 'timelimit', if you have a fast connection to your LDAP server, we recommend lowering this value
    * Defaults to 20

#####################
# Map roles
#####################

[roleMap_<authSettings-key>]
    * The mapping of Splunk roles to LDAP groups for the LDAP strategy specified by <authSettings-key>
    * IMPORTANT: this role mapping ONLY applies to the specified strategy.
    * Follow this stanza name with several Role-to-Group(s) mappings as defined below.

<Splunk RoleName> = <LDAP group string>
    * Maps a Splunk role (from authorize.conf) to LDAP groups
    * This LDAP group list is semicolon delimited (no spaces).
    * List several of these attribute value pairs to map several Splunk roles to LDAP Groups

# Scripted authentication
#####################

[<authSettings-key>]
	* Follow this stanza name with the following attribute/value pairs:

scriptPath = <string> 
   	* REQUIRED
	* This is the full path to the script, including the path to the program that runs it (python)
   	* For example: "$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/python" "$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/bin/$MY_SCRIPT"
        * Note: If a path contains spaces, it must be quoted. The example above handles the case where 
$SPLUNK_HOME contains a space

scriptSearchFilters = [1|0]
        * OPTIONAL - Only set this to 1 to call the script to add search filters.
        * 0 disables (default)

[cacheTiming]
        * Use these settings to adjust how long Splunk will use the answers returned from script functions before calling them again.

userLoginTTL = <time range string>
        * Timeout for the userLogin script function.
        * These return values are cached on a per-user basis.
        * The default is '0' (no caching)

getUserInfoTTL = <time range string>
        * Timeout for the getUserInfo script function.
        * These return values are cached on a per-user basis.
        * The default is '10s'

getUsersTTL = <time range string>
        * Timeout for the getUsers script function.
        * There is only one global getUsers cache (it is not tied to a specific user).
        * The default is '10s'

* All timeouts can be expressed in seconds or as a search-like time range
* Examples include '30' (30 seconds), '2mins' (2 minutes), '24h' (24 hours), etc.
* You can opt to use no caching for a particular function by setting the value to '0'
    * Be aware that this can severely hinder performance as a result of heavy script invocation
* Choosing the correct values for cache timing involves a tradeoff between new information latency and general performance
    * High values yield better performance from calling the script less, but introduces a latency in picking up changes
    * Low values will pick up changes in your external auth system more quickly, but may slow down performance due to increased script invocations
