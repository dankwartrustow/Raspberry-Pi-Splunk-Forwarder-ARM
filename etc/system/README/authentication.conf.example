#   Version 6.0
#
# This is an example authentication.conf. authentication.conf is used to configure LDAP and Scripted
# authentication in addition to Splunk's native authentication.
#
# To use one of these configurations, copy the configuration block into authentication.conf 
# in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/.  You must reload auth in manager or restart Splunk to enable configurations.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see the documentation 
# located at http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles

##### Use just Splunk's built-in authentication (default):
[authentication]
authType = Splunk


##### LDAP examples

#### Basic LDAP configuration example
[authentication]
authType = LDAP
authSettings = ldaphost

[ldaphost]
host = ldaphost.domain.com
port = 389
SSLEnabled = 0
bindDN = cn=Directory Manager
bindDNpassword = password
userBaseDN = ou=People,dc=splunk,dc=com
userBaseFilter = (objectclass=splunkusers)
groupBaseDN = ou=Groups,dc=splunk,dc=com
groupBaseFilter = (objectclass=splunkgroups)
userNameAttribute = uid
realNameAttribute = givenName
groupMappingAttribute = dn
groupMemberAttribute = uniqueMember
groupNameAttribute = cn
timelimit = 10
network_timeout = 15

# This stanza maps roles you have created in authorize.conf to LDAP Groups
[roleMap_ldaphost]
admin = SplunkAdmins

#### Example using the same server as 'ldaphost', but treating each user as their own group
[authentication]
authType = LDAP
authSettings = ldaphost_usergroups

[ldaphost_usergroups]
host = ldaphost.domain.com
port = 389
SSLEnabled = 0
bindDN = cn=Directory Manager
bindDNpassword = password
userBaseDN = ou=People,dc=splunk,dc=com
userBaseFilter = (objectclass=splunkusers)
groupBaseDN = ou=People,dc=splunk,dc=com
groupBaseFilter = (objectclass=splunkusers)
userNameAttribute = uid
realNameAttribute = givenName
groupMappingAttribute = uid
groupMemberAttribute = uid
groupNameAttribute = uid
timelimit = 10
network_timeout = 15

[roleMap_ldaphost_usergroups]
admin = admin_user1;admin_user2;admin_user3;admin_user4
power = power_user1;power_user2
user = user1;user2;user3

#### Sample Configuration for Active Directory (AD)
[authentication]
authSettings = AD
authType = LDAP

[AD]
SSLEnabled = 1
bindDN = ldap_bind@splunksupport.kom
bindDNpassword = ldap_bind_user_password
groupBaseDN = CN=Groups,DC=splunksupport,DC=kom
groupBaseFilter =
groupMappingAttribute = dn
groupMemberAttribute = member
groupNameAttribute = cn
host = ADbogus.splunksupport.kom
port = 636
realNameAttribute = cn
userBaseDN = CN=Users,DC=splunksupport,DC=kom
userBaseFilter =
userNameAttribute = sAMAccountName
timelimit = 15
network_timeout = 20
anonymous_referrals = 0

[roleMap_AD]
admin = SplunkAdmins
power = SplunkPowerUsers
user = SplunkUsers

#### Sample Configuration for Sun LDAP Server
[authentication]
authSettings = SunLDAP
authType = LDAP

[SunLDAP]
SSLEnabled = 0
bindDN = cn=Directory Manager
bindDNpassword = Directory_Manager_Password
groupBaseDN = ou=Groups,dc=splunksupport,dc=com
groupBaseFilter =
groupMappingAttribute = dn
groupMemberAttribute = uniqueMember
groupNameAttribute = cn
host = ldapbogus.splunksupport.com
port = 389
realNameAttribute = givenName
userBaseDN = ou=People,dc=splunksupport,dc=com
userBaseFilter =
userNameAttribute = uid
timelimit = 5
network_timeout = 8

[roleMap_SunLDAP]
admin = SplunkAdmins
power = SplunkPowerUsers
user = SplunkUsers

#### Sample Configuration for OpenLDAP
[authentication]
authSettings = OpenLDAP
authType = LDAP

[OpenLDAP]
bindDN = uid=directory_bind,cn=users,dc=osx,dc=company,dc=com
bindDNpassword = directory_bind_account_password
groupBaseFilter =
groupNameAttribute = cn
SSLEnabled = 0
port = 389
userBaseDN = cn=users,dc=osx,dc=company,dc=com
host = hostname_OR_IP
userBaseFilter =
userNameAttribute = uid
groupMappingAttribute = uid
groupBaseDN = dc=osx,dc=company,dc=com
groupMemberAttribute = memberUid
realNameAttribute = cn
timelimit = 5
network_timeout = 8
dynamicGroupFilter = (objectclass=groupOfURLs)
dynamicMemberAttribute = memberURL
nestedGroups = 1

[roleMap_OpenLDAP]
admin = SplunkAdmins
power = SplunkPowerUsers
user = SplunkUsers


##### Scripted Auth examples

#### The following example is for RADIUS authentication:
[authentication]
authType = Scripted
authSettings = script

[script]
scriptPath = "$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/python" "$SPLUNK_HOME/share/splunk/authScriptSamples/radiusScripted.py"

# Cache results for 1 second per call
[cacheTiming]
userLoginTTL    = 1
getUserInfoTTL  = 1
getUsersTTL     = 1


#### The following example works with PAM authentication:
[authentication]
authType = Scripted
authSettings = script

[script]
scriptPath = "$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/python" "$SPLUNK_HOME/share/splunk/authScriptSamples/pamScripted.py"

# Cache results for different times per function
[cacheTiming]
userLoginTTL    = 30s
getUserInfoTTL  = 1min
getUsersTTL     = 5mins
