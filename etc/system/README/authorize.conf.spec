#   Version 6.0 
#
# This file contains possible attribute/value pairs for creating roles in authorize.conf.  
# You can configure roles and granular access controls by creating your own authorize.conf.

# There is an authorize.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default/.  To set custom configurations, 
# place an authorize.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/. For examples, see 
# authorize.conf.example.  You must restart Splunk to enable configurations.
# 
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see the documentation 
# located at http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles

# GLOBAL SETTINGS
# Use the [default] stanza to define any global settings.
#     * You can also define global settings outside of any stanza, at the top of the file.
#     * Each conf file should have at most one default stanza. If there are multiple default
#       stanzas, attributes are combined. In the case of multiple definitions of the same
#       attribute, the last definition in the file wins.
#     * If an attribute is defined at both the global level and in a specific stanza, the
#       value in the specific stanza takes precedence.

[capability::<capability>]
        * DO NOT edit, remove, or add capability stanzas. The existing capabilities are the full set of Splunk system capabilities.
	* Splunk adds all of its capabilities this way
	* For the default list of capabilities and assignments, see authorize.conf under the 'default' directory
        * Descriptions of specific capabilities are listed below.

[role_<roleName>]
<capability> = <enabled>
  	* A capability that is enabled for this role.
  	* You can list many of these.
        * Note that 'enabled' is the only accepted value here, as capabilities are disabled by default.
        * Roles inherit all capabilities from imported roles, and inherited capabilities cannot be disabled.
	* Role names cannot have uppercase characters. User names, however, are case-insensitive.

importRoles = <string>
  	* Semicolon delimited list of other roles and their associated capabilities that should be imported.
	* Importing other roles also imports the other aspects of that role, such as allowed indexes to search.
        * By default a role imports no other roles.

srchFilter = <string>
   	* Semicolon delimited list of search filters for this Role.
        * By default we perform no search filtering.
        * To override any search filters from imported roles, set this to '*', as the 'admin' role does.

srchTimeWin = <number>
	* Maximum time span of a search, in seconds.
            * This time window limit is applied backwards from the latest time specified in a search.
        * By default, searches are not limited to any specific time window.
        * To override any search time windows from imported roles, set this to '0' (infinite), as the 'admin' role does.
        * -1 is a special value that implies no search window has been set for this role
            * This is equivalent to not setting srchTimeWin at all, which means it can be easily overridden by an imported role

srchDiskQuota = <number>
	* Maximum amount of disk space (MB) that can be used by search jobs of a user that belongs to this role
        * Defaults to '100', for 100 MB.

srchJobsQuota = <number>
	* Maximum number of concurrently running historical searches a member of this role can have.
	* This excludes real-time searches, see rtSrchJobsQuota.
        * Defaults to 3.
	
rtSrchJobsQuota = <number>
	* Maximum number of concurrently running real-time searches a member of this role can have.
        * Defaults to 6.

srchMaxTime = <number><unit>
        * Maximum amount of time that searches of users from this role will be allowed to run.
        * Once the search has been ran for this amount of time it will be auto finalized, If the role
        * inherits from other roles, the maximum srchMaxTime value specified in the included roles.
        * This maximum does not apply to real-time searches.
        * Examples: 1h, 10m, 2hours, 2h, 2hrs, 100s etc...
        * Defaults to 100days

srchIndexesDefault = <string>
	* Semicolon delimited list of indexes to search when no index is specified
	* These indexes can be wildcarded, with the exception that '*' does not match internal indexes
	* To match internal indexes, start with '_'. All internal indexes are represented by '_*'
        * Defaults to none, but the UI will automatically populate this with 'main' in manager

srchIndexesAllowed = <string>
	* Semicolon delimited list of indexes this role is allowed to search
	* Follows the same wildcarding semantics as srchIndexesDefault
        * Defaults to none, but the UI will automatically populate this with '*' in manager

cumulativeSrchJobsQuota = <number>
        * Maximum number of concurrently running historical searches that all members of this role can have.
        * NOTE: if a user belongs to multiple roles then s/he will first consume searches from the roles with 
        *       the largest cumulative search quota, when the quota of a role is completely used up then roles
        *       with lower quotas will be examined. 

cumulativeRTSrchJobsQuota = <number>
        * Maximum number of concurrently running real-time searches that all members of this role can have.
        * NOTE: if a user belongs to multiple roles then s/he will first consume searches from the roles with 
        *       the largest cumulative search quota, when the quota of a role is completely used up then roles
        *       with lower quotas will be examined.
