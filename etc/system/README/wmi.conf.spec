#   Version 6.0 
#
# This file contains possible attribute/value pairs for configuring 
# Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) access from Splunk.  
#
# There is a wmi.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME\etc\system\default\.  To set 
# custom configurations, place a wmi.conf in 
# $SPLUNK_HOME\etc\system\local\. For examples, see wmi.conf.example.
#
# You must restart Splunk to enable configurations.
# 
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see the
# documentation located at 
# http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles

#----GLOBAL SETTINGS-----
###################################################################

[settings]
* The settings stanza specifies various runtime parameters.
* The entire stanza and every parameter within it is optional. 
* If the stanza is missing, Splunk assumes system defaults.

initial_backoff = <integer>
* How long, in seconds, to wait before retrying the connection to
the WMI provider after the first connection error.
* If connection errors continue, the wait time doubles until it reaches
the integer specified in max_backoff.
* Defaults to 5.

max_backoff = <integer>
* The maximum time, in seconds, to attempt to reconnect to the
WMI provider.
* Defaults to 20.

max_retries_at_max_backoff = <integer>
* Once max_backoff is reached, tells Splunk how many times to attempt
to reconnect to the WMI provider.  
* Splunk will try to reconnect every max_backoff seconds.
* If reconnection fails after max_retries, give up forever (until restart).
* Defaults to 2.

checkpoint_sync_interval = <integer>
* The minimum wait time, in seconds, for state data (event log checkpoint)
to be written to disk.
* Defaults to 2.

#----INPUT-SPECIFIC SETTINGS-----
###################################################################

[WMI:$NAME]
* There are two types of WMI stanzas:
 * Event log: for pulling event logs. You must set the 
   event_log_file attribute.
 * WQL: for issuing raw Windows Query Language (WQL) requests. You 
   must set the wql attribute.
 * Do not use both the event_log_file or the wql attributes.  Use 
   one or the other.

server = <comma-separated strings>
* A comma-separated list of servers from which to get data.
* If not present, defaults to the local machine.

interval = <integer>
* How often, in seconds, to poll for new data.
* This attribute is required, and the input will not run if the attribute is
  not present.
* There is no default.

disabled = [0|1]
* Specifies whether the input is enabled or not.
* 1 to disable the input, 0 to enable it.
* Defaults to 0 (enabled).

hostname = <host>
* All results generated by this stanza will appear to have arrived from
  the string specified here.
* This attribute is optional.  
* If it is not present, the input will detect the host automatically.

current_only = [0|1]
* Changes the characteristics and interaction of WMI-based event collections.
* When current_only is set to 1:
  * For event log stanzas, this will only capture events that occur
    while Splunk is running.
  * For WQL stanzas, event notification queries are expected.  The 
    queried class must support sending events.  Failure to supply 
    the correct event notification query structure will cause
    WMI to return a syntax error.
  * An example event notification query that watches for process creation:
    * SELECT * FROM __InstanceCreationEvent WITHIN 1 WHERE 
      TargetInstance ISA 'Win32_Process'.
* When current_only is set to 0:
  * For event log stanzas, all the events from the checkpoint are 
    gathered. If there is no checkpoint, all events starting from
    the oldest events are retrieved.
  * For WQL stanzas, the query is executed and results are retrieved.
    The query is a non-notification query.
  * For example
    * Select * Win32_Process where caption = "explorer.exe"
* Defaults to 0.

index = <string>
* Specifies the index that this input should send the data to.
* This attribute is optional.
* When defined, "index=" is automatically prepended to <string>.
* Defaults to "index=main" (or whatever you have set as your default index).

#####
# Event log-specific attributes:
#####

event_log_file = <Application, System, etc>
* Tells Splunk to expect event log data for this stanza, and specifies
  the event log channels you want Splunk to monitor.
* Use this instead of WQL to specify sources.
* Specify one or more event log channels to poll.  Multiple event log
  channels must be separated by commas.
* There is no default.

disable_hostname_normalization = [0|1]
* If set to true, hostname normalization is disabled
* If absent or set to false, the hostname for 'localhost' will be converted to %COMPUTERNAME%.
* 'localhost' refers to the following list of strings: localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1, the name of the DNS domain for the local computer,
* the fully qualified DNS name, the NetBIOS name, the DNS host name of the local computer

#####
# WQL-specific attributes:
#####

wql = <string>
* Tells Splunk to expect data from a WMI provider for this stanza, and
  specifies the WQL query you want Splunk to make to gather that data.
* Use this if you are not using the event_log_file attribute.
* Ensure that your WQL queries are syntactically and structurally correct
  when using this option.
* For example, 
  SELECT * FROM Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfProc_Process WHERE Name = "splunkd".
* If you wish to use event notification queries, you must also set the
  "current_only" attribute to 1 within the stanza, and your query must be 
  appropriately structured for event notification (meaning it must contain
  one or more of the GROUP, WITHIN or HAVING clauses.)
* For example, 
  SELECT * FROM __InstanceCreationEvent WITHIN 1 WHERE TargetInstance ISA
  'Win32_Process'
* There is no default.

namespace = <string>
* The namespace where the WMI provider resides.
* The namespace spec can either be relative (root\cimv2) or absolute 
  (\\server\root\cimv2).
* If the server attribute is present, you cannot specify an absolute namespace.
* Defaults to root\cimv2.
