#   Version 6.0
#
# This file contains possible attributes and values for configuring global 
# saved search actions in alert_actions.conf.  Saved searches are configured 
# in savedsearches.conf.
#
# There is an alert_actions.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default/.  To set custom configurations, 
# place an alert_actions.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/.  For examples, see 
# alert_actions.conf.example. You must restart Splunk to enable configurations.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see the documentation 
# located at http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles

# GLOBAL SETTINGS
# Use the [default] stanza to define any global settings.
#     * You can also define global settings outside of any stanza, at the top of the file.
#     * Each conf file should have at most one default stanza. If there are multiple default
#       stanzas, attributes are combined. In the case of multiple definitions of the same
#       attribute, the last definition in the file wins.
#     * If an attribute is defined at both the global level and in a specific stanza, the
#       value in the specific stanza takes precedence.

maxresults = <integer>
	* Set the global maximum number of search results sent via alerts.
	* Defaults to 100.

hostname = [protocol]<host>[:<port>]
	* Sets the hostname used in the web link (url) sent in alerts.
	* This value accepts two forms.
	   * hostname
		examples: splunkserver, splunkserver.example.com
	   * protocol://hostname:port
		examples: http://splunkserver:8000, https://splunkserver.example.com:443
	* When this value is a simple hostname, the protocol and port which
	  are configured within splunk are used to construct the base of
	  the url.
	* When this value begins with 'http://', it is used verbatim.  
	  NOTE: This means the correct port must be specified if it is not
	  the default port for http or https.
	* This is useful in cases when the Splunk server is not aware of
	  how to construct an externally referenceable url, such as SSO
	  environments, other proxies, or when the Splunk server hostname
	  is not generally resolvable.
	* Defaults to current hostname provided by the operating system, 
	  or if that fails, "localhost".
	* When set to empty, default behavior is used.

ttl     = <integer>[p]
	* optional argument specifying the minimum time to live (in seconds) 
	  of the search artifacts, if this action is triggered.
 	* if p follows integer, then integer is the number of 
	  scheduled periods.
	* If no actions are triggered, the artifacts will have their ttl
	  determined by the "dispatch.ttl" attribute in savedsearches.conf.
	* Defaults to 10p 
	* Defaults to 86400 (24 hours)   for: email, rss
	* Defaults to   600 (10 minutes) for: script 
	* Defaults to   120 (2 minutes)  for: summary_index, populate_lookup 
 
maxtime = <integer>[m|s|h|d]
	* The maximum amount of time that the execution of an action
	  is allowed to take before the action is aborted.
	* Use the d, h, m and s suffixes to define the period of time:
	  d = day, h = hour, m = minute and s = second.
	  For example: 5d means 5 days.
	* Defaults to 5m for everything except rss.
	* Defaults to 1m for rss.
 
track_alert = [1|0]
 	* indicates whether the execution of this action signifies a trackable
	  alert.
 	* Defaults to 0 (false).

command = <string>
	* The search command (or pipeline) which is responsible for executing
	  the action.
	* Generally the command is a template search pipeline which is realized
	  with values from the saved search - to reference saved search
	  field values wrap them in dollar signs ($).
	* For example, to reference the savedsearch name use $name$. To
	  reference the search, use $search$
